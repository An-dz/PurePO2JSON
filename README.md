# PurePO2JSON
A converter to obtain JSON files from PO translation files written in pure JavaScript.

This project is used to help testing translation for the [Vivaldi](http://vivaldi.com) browser, but it would be fairly easy to modify it to your needs. It may also be a good way to learn something out of pure JavaScript.

There's a web interface for PurePO2JSON available [here](http://an-dz.github.io/PurePO2JSON).
